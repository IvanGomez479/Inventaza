## Second screen

The second screen shows the information related to the pressed piece, with a header with the image and a list of pieces that are inside of the pressed piece, as well as a search bar that works in the same way as the one on the first screen.

## Third screen

This third screen is the last one, and it generates a PDF document with the information of a piece and a list of all the pieces that are inside of that piece through a recursive function. It is also possible to share this PDF with the apps that are installed in the device.
